# ClientServer

     In this project I used and reused the python class that was created several times after it was created, the
functions built in there to access the data base were nice.  Especially the read function which was used most
exclusively in this work, but if the company had wanted more functionality, I could see the other functions being
used as well.  It was a definite advantage to have the middleware set up as a go between here as the database
functions themselves were a little more cumbersome, and the middleware took the steps to authenticate the user
as well.

     The client wanted to be able to get the information about the specific animals they were trying to find
that fit specific criteria.  The dashboard had to be developed to query the database to search out those types
of animals when the client selected that category of rescue operation.  This course was a little more hands on 
with the development of a product that was useable by the customer.  I think most products need to access a 
database to meet client requests in todays world I think the dash frame work could be a viable way to connect
a small business to a database in a limited way.

    As computer scientists we bring data solutions to people so they can use information in a beneficial way.
In this project we helped the company narrow their search for rescue dogs down to small manageable lists and 
gave them location information via a map and statistical data on the ages of the dogs in a pie chart by breed.
